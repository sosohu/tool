Explanation:
	Code line counter python script.

How to use:
	(1) the script is the python script, run by the Python 2.7.6
	    so you should promise you have installed the python
	(2) copy the script to the /usr/bin : sudo cp codeline /usr/bin/
	(3) set the authority for user account: sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/codeline
	(4) you can use codeline as a common shell command in some folder

		for example, now your current path is:  /home/sosohu/project/
			then, run the shell command:

		[i] Use default file format *.h, *.c, *.cc, *.cpp:

				sosohu@sosohu:project$ codeline

			you will see the total nums of code line in the path:

				.h file code lines are 711
				not exsist *.c
				.cc file code lines are 891
				.cpp file code lines are 1

				all code lines are 1603

		[ii] Set the file format by add one or more args after the command codeline:

				sosohu@sosohu:project$ codeline h cc sh

			you will see the total nums of code line in the path(*.h, *.cc, *.sh):
				
				.h file code lines are 726
				.cc file code lines are 927
				.sh file code lines are 6

				all code lines are 1659

Note:
	Now, this version can not only supply the default file format(*.h, *.c, *.cc, *.cpp)
but also be set file format by add the arg.
