Explanation:
	Code line counter shell script.

How to use:
	(1) copy the script to the /usr/bin : sudo cp codeline /usr/bin/
	(2) set the authority for user account: sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/codeline
	(3) you can use codeline as a common shell command in some folder

		for example, now your current path is:  /home/sosohu/project/
			then, run the shell command:
				sosohu@sosohu:project$ codeline
			you will see the total nums of code line in the path:

				.h file code lines are 711
				not exsist *.c
				.cc file code lines are 891
				.cpp file code lines are 1

				all code lines are 1603
		

Note:
	Now, the version only supply the default file format(*.h, *.c, *.cc, *.cpp)
in the future, I will maintenance it so that it can be set file format by user.
