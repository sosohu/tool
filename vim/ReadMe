Explanation:
	Vim configure file.

How to use:
	(1) copy the file vimrc to the /home/user/.vimrc : 
		cp vimrc /home/user/.vimrc			# user is yout account name
	(2)	copy the file taglist.vim to the /home/user/.vim/plugin/ :
		cp taglist.vim /home/sosohu/.vim/plugin/
	(2) you can use vim to open file and find some new things:
		press F3: open/close the TlistToggle      # you must have install the ctags
		press F4: insert the author information   # you can edir the vimrc to modify the personal information
		support the num count
		support the syntax height light
		support the back to the last read place
		set tab = 4 space
		set search height light
Note:
	Now, this version can support these things above, I belive these are just elmentary feature and I will 
continue to add new feature in the future.
