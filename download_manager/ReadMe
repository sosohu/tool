Explanation:
	Download file manage script.

How to use:
	(1) the script is the python script, run by the Python 2.7.6
	    so you should promise you have installed the python
	(2) copy the script to the /usr/bin : sudo cp dmanage /usr/bin/
	(3) set the authority for user account: sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/codeline
	(4) you can use dmanage as a common shell command 

		[i] Use default download dir and backup dir:

				sosohu@sosohu:~$  dmanage

				then the script will move the compress files in the default 
				dir(/home/username/Download) to the default backup folder
				(/home/usename/backup).


		[ii] Set the download dir and backup dir:

				sosohu@sosohu:project$ dmanage /home/mydownload /home/mybackup

				then the script will move the compress files in the mydownload to 
				the mybackup folder.


Note:
	Now, this version can not only supply the default file format(*.gz, *.bz2, *.zip, *.tar)
